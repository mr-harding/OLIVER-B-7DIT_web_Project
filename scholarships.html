            <div><p>Another scholarship we offer is a part ride scholarship, where the athlete will have SOME of his/her living expenses paid for along with a free education, this is for students who may be not considering university due to high costs but who have potential and could be an asset to our programme.</p></div>

          <div class="container">
            <div class="image"></div>
            <div><p>Our other scholarship we offer is our education scholarship. Where the student has to pay for all their living expenses and programme fees yet recieves a free education. This is a scholarship we hand out heavily as it is not very resource heavy. It gives the student an oppurtunity to play college sport without worrying too much about the expenses.</p></div>
